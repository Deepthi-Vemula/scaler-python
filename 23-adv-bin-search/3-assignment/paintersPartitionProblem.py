# Q1. Painter's Partition Problem
# Problem Description
# Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
# You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
#
# Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
# NOTE:
# 1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
# 2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
#
# Return the ans % 10000003.
#
#
#
# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= A <= 1000
# 1 <= B <= 106
# 1 <= N <= 105
# 1 <= C[i] <= 106
#
#
#
# Input Format
# The first argument given is the integer A.
# The second argument given is the integer B.
# The third argument given is the integer array C.
#
#
#
# Output Format
# Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.
#
#
#
# Example Input
# Input 1:
#
# A = 2
# B = 5
# C = [1, 10]
# Input 2:
#
# A = 10
# B = 1
# C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
#
#
# Example Output
# Output 1:
#
# 50
# Output 2:
#
# 11
#
#
# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:
#
# Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
# Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
# There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
# ans = 50 % 10000003
# Explanation 2:
#
# Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3
# and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
# ans = 11 % 10000003
